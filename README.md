# Drag-n-Drop-ToDoApp
live demo: https://bartosz90.github.io/Drag-n-Drop-ToDoApp/

Simple draggable to-do app, made with pure js, css and html:

- each new task is a draggable element with random-generated border color (not working at mobile devices). Sometimes drag and drop system crashes, especially when dragging fast - yet to be fixed
- includes search bar, which highlights searched term
